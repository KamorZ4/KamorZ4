ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kamorzy

## Profile

I create Minecraft resource packs, data packs, and Fabric/Quilt mods. Currently, I host my minecraft projects as follows:

- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Kamorzy) (_Highest priority for mods and resource packs_)
  - Mods
  - Resource Packs
- [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/kamorzy/) (_Highest priority for data packs_)
  - Data Packs
  - Resource Packs
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Kamorzy/) (_Source codes and issue reporting_)
  - Mods
  - Data Packs
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzzimoda/projects) (_Releases commonly delayed_)
  - Mods
  - Resource Packs

I currently try to stay close to vanilla-plus designs, sometimes fixing "issues" I have with vanilla or making modest additions and QoL changes. Overhauls are reserved for features that are so poorly designed imo that I avoid them entirely in my games, regardless of how beneficial they are.

## Current Releases
- Resource Packs
  - [Invisible Armor for Players (Only)](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/invisible-armor-for-players-only)
  - [Darker Iron](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/darker-iron)
