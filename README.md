Hi, Iâ€™m Kamorzy [<img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi_stroke_cup.svg" width=2.5% height=2.5%>](https://www.ko-fi.com/kamorzy)

## Profile

I create Minecraft resource packs, data packs, and Fabric/Quilt mods.

I currently try to stay close to vanilla-plus designs, sometimes fixing "issues" I have with vanilla or making modest additions and QoL changes. Overhauls are reserved for features that are so poorly designed imo that I avoid them entirely in my games, regardless of how beneficial they are.

## Current Releases

  - [Invisible Armor for Players (Only)](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/invisible-armor-for-players-only)
