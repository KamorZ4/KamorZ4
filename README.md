## Profile

I create Minecraft resource packs, data packs, and Fabric/Quilt mods.

For mods, I mostly stick to vanilla-like designs, filling niches that vanilla features don't cover. The design philophy for my content is roughly:
  - Smooth out progression (usually designed for early-mid game)
  - Encourage more player engagement in vanilla gameplay
  - Maintain and enhance the value of vanilla features
  - Incentivize more thought and optimization on the players' parts

My releases can be found on:
